# Run Buddy
## Description 
This was the first website I ever put together.  It was a lesson for the UCLA extention bootcamp.  This project only used HTML and CSS, so all the animations you see do not use js.  The website is for a theoretical company called run buddy; and the purpose is to capture user information so that trainers can reach out and start working with clients.
